1. Introduction to conditionalstatements: if, else, elif.
Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your code. 
These statements allow you to run certain blocks of code only if a condition is met (i.e., if it's True). 
Python provides three main conditional statements: if, else, and elif.

1. if Statement:
The if statement checks if a condition is True. If it is, the block of code inside the if statement runs. 
If the condition is False, the program skips the block of code and moves on.

2. else Statement
The else statement runs if the condition in the if statement is False. 
It provides an alternative block of code to execute when the if condition is not met.

3. elif (Else If) Statement
The elif statement stands for "else if" and allows you to check multiple conditions. 
It follows an if statement and can be used to check additional conditions if the first condition is False.

2. Nested if-else conditions.
Nested if-else conditions refer to placing one if-else statement inside another. 
This allows you to check multiple conditions in a hierarchical or layered manner.
Nested if-else lets you make more specific decisions by placing one conditional statement inside another.
It allows you to handle complex conditions in layers, checking different conditions based on previous ones.
syntax:
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # code if both condition1 and condition2 are True
    else:
        # code if condition1 is True and condition2 is False
else:
    # code if condition1 is False
