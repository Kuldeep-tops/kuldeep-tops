1.Accessing tuple elements using positive and negative indexing.
Here's a simple Python program to demonstrate how to access tuple elements using positive and negative indexing
Positive Indexing: Starts from 0 and goes forward (e.g., my_tuple[0] is the first element).
Negative Indexing: Starts from -1 and goes backward (e.g., my_tuple[-1] is the last element)
# Define a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Accessing the first element using positive indexing
print(my_tuple[-1])  # Accessing the last element using negative indexing
print(my_tuple[-5])  # Accessing the first element using negative indexinner
print(my_tuple[-3])  # Accessing the third element from the end using negative indexing

2.Slicing a tuple to access ranges of elements.
Here's a simple Python program to slice a tuple and access ranges of elements
my_tuple[start:end] This slices the tuple from start index to end - 1 index.
Omitting start or end
If start is omitted, it starts from the beginning.
If end is omitted, it goes until the end.
licing allows you to access a range of elements from a tuple.
The format for slicing is tuple[start:end], where start is the index where the slice begins, and end is the index where the slice ends (not included).
