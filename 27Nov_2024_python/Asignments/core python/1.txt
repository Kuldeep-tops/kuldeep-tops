2. History and evolution of Python.
ans. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for its simplicity, readability,
and versatility. Its history spans over three decades, and it has evolved significantly over the years to become 
one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Today, Python is one of the most popular languages globally, known for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive 
library support in fields like web development, AI, and data science.

3. Advantages of using Python over other programming languages.
ans. Python's ease of use, vast ecosystem of libraries, cross-platform capabilities, and versatility make it a powerful and appealing 
choice for a wide range of tasks, from simple automation scripts to complex data science applications and web development.
Easy to Learn and Use - Simple Syntax: Python's syntax is clean, intuitive, and similar to English, making it beginner-friendly.
Shorter Code: Tasks that require multiple lines in other languages can often be done in fewer lines using Python.

Versatility - used in diverse fields like data science, web development, etc.

Extensive Libraries and Frameworks - It's comes with a vast standard library and third-party libraries, saving time and effort.

Open Source and Free - Python is free to use, distribute, and modify, with active contributions from the global developer community.

Interpreted Language - Python is executed line by line, making it easier to debug and test code compared to other compiled languages.

4. Installing Python and setting up the development environment (Anaconda, PyCharm, or VS
Code).
ans. Downloaded and installed from official website.
VS code is the code editor that supports python through extensions.
Download and installed VS code and start coding.VS Code is great for general-purpose Python development, offering flexibility and extensibility.

5. Writing and executing your first Python program.
ans.The first program i have executed is basic hello world program that is to check the working an then other function get added.
print("hello world")it was easy to programed that every programmer writes at beginner level.
