Control Statements (Break, Continue, Pass)
1.Understanding the role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops
In Python, break, continue, and pass are control statements that are used to alter the flow of execution in loops.
break:
The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, even if the loop condition is still true.
It stops the loop completely and moves on to the next part of the program.Stops the loop entirely.
continue:
The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop,
without executing the remaining code inside the loop for that iteration.Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
pass:
The pass statement is a null operation. It does nothing when executed. 
It's useful as a placeholder where code is required syntactically but you don't want to execute anything.Does nothing (acts as a placeholder).
