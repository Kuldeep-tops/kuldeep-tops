1. Understanding Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines.
ans. PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal 8.
The primary goal of PEP 8 is to ensure that Python code is easy to read and maintain code is easy way.
its provide readeble code providing recommendations on how to write clean, readable, and consistent Python code.

2. Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.
ans.  Indentation: 4 spaces per indentation level  to define the structure of the code (instead of curly braces or other markers)
 comments: Single-line comments: Begin with a hash symbol (#). Everything after # on that line is considered a comment.
 Multi-line comments: Use triple quotes (''' or """) for multi-line strings that are not assigned to any variable, which Python interprets as comments.
 naming conventions: Variable names: Use snake_case for variables and function names. This means all lowercase letters with words separated by underscores.
Example: user_age, total_sum, file_path

3. Writing readable and maintainable code.
To write readable and maintainable in a python, Add clear comments and docstrings to explain the why behind complex code.
Keep the code simple, avoiding overly clever or complex solutions.
Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
Use consistent naming conventions and formatting throughout the codebase.
Write tests and use version control.
Follow PEP 8 guidelines for consistent formatting and style.
