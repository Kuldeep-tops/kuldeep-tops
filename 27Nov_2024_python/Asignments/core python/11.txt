Python â€“ Collections, functions and Modules

1.Understanding how to create and access elements in a list.
A list in Python is a collection of items or elements that can be of different data types (integers, strings, etc.). 
You can create a list and access its elements in a very simple way.

1.Creating a List:
You create a list by using square brackets [], and separating each element with a comma.
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 'apple', 'banana', 40]

2.Accessing Elements in a List:
You can access elements in a list using their index. The index starts from 0 for the first element.
print(my_list[0])  
print(my_list[3])

3.Negative Indexing:
You can also access elements from the end of the list using negative indexes. -1 is the last element, -2 is the second-to-last, and so on.
print(my_list[-1])
print(my_list[-3])

4.Modifying List Elements:
You can change an element in a list by accessing it through its index and assigning a new value.
my_list[0] = 100
print(my_list)

5.Adding Elements to a List:
You can add elements to a list using methods like append() or insert().
my_list.append(50)
print(my_list)

2.Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).
Indexing in Python lists allows you to access individual elements in a list using their positions (indexes).
1. Positive Indexing:
In positive indexing, the index starts at 0 for the first element and increases by 1 for each subsequent element
2.Negative Indexing:
In negative indexing, the index starts from -1 for the last element and decreases by 1 for each
preceding element.

3.Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements.
Slicing a list in Python allows you to access a range of elements from a list, rather than just a single element.
You can use the following syntax to slice a list: list[start:stop:step].
Basic Slicing:
If you just want a portion of the list (from start to stop-1)
Omitting the Start or Stop:
Omitting start: Starts from the beginning of the list.
Using Step (Skipping Elements):
The step allows you to skip elements.
Using Step (Skipping Elements):
The step allows you to skip elements.
Negative Indexing with Slicing:
You can also use negative indexing to slice from the end of the list
