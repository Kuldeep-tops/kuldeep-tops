1. Understanding data types: integers, floats,strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries,sets.
1. Integers (int)
Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative, without decimal points.
Example: 5, -3, 100, 0
2. Floats (float)
Floats are numbers that contain decimal points.
Example: 3.14, -0.5, 100.0
3. Strings (str)
Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes (").
Example: "hello", 'world', "123", 'Python 3'
4. Lists (list)
A list is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type (integers, strings, etc.). Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.
Example: [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
5. Tuples (tuple)
A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable. Once you create a tuple, you cannot change its contents.
Example: (1, 2, 3), ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
6. Dictionaries (dict)
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You use keys to access the corresponding values.
Example: {"name": "John", "age": 25}

2. Python variables and memory allocation.
variable: A variable in Python is like a container that holds a value. You can store numbers, text, lists, and other data types in variables.
variables are used to store values, and memory allocation refers to how Python assigns memory to those variables.
Python automatically manages memory for you. When you create a variable and assign it a value,in python.
Memory Allocation: Python assigns a portion of the computerâ€™s memory to store the value you assigned to the variable.
Automatic Memory Management: Python uses something called garbage collection to automatically free memory when it is no longer in use.

example: x = 5      # Assigns integer 5 to variable x
         y = x      # y now points to the same memory location as x
         x = 10     # Now x points to a new memory location with the value 10
        print(x)    # Output: 10
        print(y)     # Output: 5
        
3. Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.
Operators in Python are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
when we use in operations are known as operands, and operation are operands and variables are known as operaters.

Arithmetic operators: (+, -, \*, /, % (modulus), ** (exponentiation))
These are used for basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
we use arithmatic operators for performs mathematical operations.

Comparison operators: (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
These operators compare two values and return True or False depending on the result of the comparison.
we use comparison operators to compaire two variables values with each others.

Logical operators: (and, or, not)
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return True or False based on the conditions.
we use cobined contional statement to find probability likes its value true or false.

Bitwise operators: (& (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwis XOR), ~ (bitwise NOT), << (left shift), >> (right shift))
Bitwise operators work on the binary representations of integers (the 0s and 1s in the numbers). 
These operators perform operations on each bit of the number.Perform operations and gives binary values.
