1.Common list operations: concatenation, repetition, membership.
2.2.1.1. Concatenation
Concatenation is the process of combining two or more lists into a single list. In Python,
the `+` operator is used for concatenation.
repetition
Repetition is the process of creating a list that contains a specified element repeated a specified number of times
membership
Membership is the process of checking if an element is present in a list or not.
List operations: indexing, slicing, and membership testing.
Indexing
Indexing is the process of accessing a specific element in a list by its index. In Python,
the index of the first element is 0.
Slicing
Slicing is the process of extracting a subset of elements from a list. In Python, the syntax
is used for slicing.
Membership testing
Membership testing is the process of checking if an element is present in a list or not. In Python
, the `in` keyword is used for membership testing.
List methods
List methods: append, extend, insert, remove, pop
Append
The `append()` method adds an element to the end of the list.
Extend
The `extend()` method adds multiple elements to the end of the list.
Insert
The `insert()` method inserts an element at a specified position in the list.
Remove
The `remove()` method removes the first occurrence of a specified element from the list.
Pop
The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element from the list.
List comprehensions
List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing the expression, which
is executed for each element, along with the for loop to loop over the elements.

2.Understanding list methods like append(), insert(), remove(), pop().
Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of common list methods in Python: append(), insert(), remove(), and pop().
append(): This method adds an element to the end of the list. It takes one argument, the element to be added.
insert(): This method inserts an element at a specified position in the list. It takes two arguments,
the position and the element to be inserted.
remove(): This method removes the first occurrence of a specified element from the list. It takes one argument
the element to be removed.
pop(): This method removes and returns the last element from the list. It takes one argument, the index of the element to be removed.
