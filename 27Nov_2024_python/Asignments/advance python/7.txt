1. Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical, and Hybrid inheritance in Python.
single inheritance - A single inheritance in Python that can be used to create multiple inheritance structures in the same hierarchy
multilevel inheritance - A multilevel inheritance in Python that can be  used to create multiple inheritance structures in the same hierarchy
when using between two or more inheritance structures in the same hierarchy.
hierarchy inheritence - A hierarchy in Python that can be used to create multiple inheritance structures in the same hierarchy when using
Hybrid inheritance - A hybrid inheritance in Python that can be used to create multiple inheritance structures in the same hierarchy when
using hybrid inheritance 

2.Using the super() function to access properties of the parent class.
To access properties of a parent class using the super() function, you typically use it within a method of a subclass.
This allows the subclass to call methods or access attributes from the parent class without explicitly naming it.
super() function helps in calling the parent classâ€™s methods and constructors without explicitly referring to the parent class name.
