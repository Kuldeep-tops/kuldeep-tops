1.Opening files in different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+').
in python programming various type of mode present in python 
'w'
'w' mode is not supported in python programming
'r' (Read): Opens the file for reading (default mode). The file must exist.
'w' (Write): Opens the file for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one. If it exists, it overwrites the content.
'a' (Append): Opens the file for appending. If the file doesn't exist, it creates
'r+' (Read/Write): Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
'w+' (Write/Read): Opens the file for both writing and reading. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one. If it exists, it overwrites the content.
'x' (Create): Opens the file for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it
creates a new one. If it exists, it raises a FileExistsError.
'r' mode is used to open a file in read mode. It is the default mode. If
the file does not exist, Python will raise an error. If the file exists, it
will be opened for reading.

2.Using the open() function to create and access files.
The open() function is used to create and access files in Python. 
The open() function takes two parameters: the name of the file and the mode in which the file should be opened.
To create a file or open an existing file in write mode ('w') or append mode ('a')
use the open() function with the 'w' or 'a' mode. To open a file
To read from an existing file, you can use the read mode ('r')
The open() function returns a file object, which has several methods and attributes for performing various file operations

3.If you want to add more content to an existing file, use append mode ('a')
If you want to add more content to an existing file, use append mode ('a'). This mode
opens the file for appending, so any new content you add will be added to the end of the file.
you can also open a file for both reading and writing using 'w+' or 'r+'.

3.Closing files using close().
The close() method is used to close a file. It is used to free up the system resources
that the file was using. It is a good practice to close the file after you are done with
it to avoid memory leaks. after you open a file using the open() function, it is important to close the file using the close() method 
to free up system resources.Opening and Closing a File When you open a file with open(), you should always close it after you're done to ensure 
the file is properly saved Automatically Closing a File Using with A better way to handle files is to use the with statement. 
It automatically takes care of closing the file after the block of code is executed
