1.Introduction to SQLite3 and PyMySQL for database connectivity
SQLite3 is a lightweight and serverless relational database engine.
It's built into Python, so no need for an external server or installation.
PyMySQL is a Python driver for MySQL, which is a popular relational database management system.
It allows you to connect to a MySQL database from Python.we will need to install PyMySQL first.
pip install pymysql use this command to install PyMySQL.

2.Creating and executing SQL queries from Python using these connectors.
We import the necessary libraries: sqlite3 for database connection and pandas for data manipulation.
import sqlite3 we use importing database 
We establish a connection to our database.
conn = sqlite3.connect('employee.db') we use to esatablish connection to the database.
We create a SQL query string.
We use pd.
Finally, we print the results and close our database connection.
conn.close() we use to close the connection.
