1.Understanding the concepts of classes, objects, attributes, and methods in Python
classes
class is a template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of an
object. A class is essentially a blueprint or a design pattern for creating objects.
attributes
An attribute is a characteristic or a property of an object. It is a variable that is associated with
an object and is used to describe or define the object's state. Attributes are also known as data
members or instance variables.
methods
A method is a function that is associated with an object. It is a block of code that is
associated with an object and is used to perform a specific action or operation on the object. Methods
are also known as functions or procedures.

2.Difference between local and global variables.
local variables
A local variable is a variable that is defined within a function or a method. 
It is a variable that is only accessible within the function or method where it is defined.
Local variables are created when a function or method is called and are destroyed when the function or method ends.

global variables
A global variable is a variable that is defined outside of a function or a method. 
It is avariable that is accessible from anywhere in the program. 
Global variables are created when a program starts and are destroyed when the program ends.
