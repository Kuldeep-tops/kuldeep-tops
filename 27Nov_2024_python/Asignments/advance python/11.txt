1.Using re.search() and re.match() functions in Pythonâ€™s re module for pattern matching
we want to check if a pattern matches only at the beginning of a string so we use re.match()
and we want to search the entire string for the first occurrence of the pattern so we can use re.search()
the re module provides functions for working with regular expressions. 
Two of the most commonly used functions are re.search() and re.match(),which allow you to search for patterns in strings.

2.Difference between search and match.
re.match():
Matches only at the beginning of the string.
It checks if the pattern starts the string.
If the pattern is found at the start, it returns a match object, otherwise None.
re.search():
Searches the entire string for the pattern, not just the beginning.
It looks anywhere in the string to find the first occurrence of the pattern.
If the pattern is found, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns None.
