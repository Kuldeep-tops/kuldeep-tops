1.Method overloading: defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
Two or more methods have the same name but different numbers of parameters and different types of parameters, or both. 
this method is called overloaded method this called method overloading.
method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) is not directly supported
like in some other programming languages.achieve similar behavior by using default parameters, variable-length arguments,
or conditional statements inside a method.


2.Method overriding: redefining a parent class method in the child class.
method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already 
defined in its parent class.This allows the child class to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class method.
