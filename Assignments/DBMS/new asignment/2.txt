1. What are the basic components of SQL syntax?

1. Keywords
SQL keywords are reserved words that have specific meaning and functionality in SQL. They are the building blocks of SQL queries.
Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, etc.
2. Clauses
Clauses are specific parts of SQL statements that define actions or conditions.
3. Expressions
Expressions combine values, operators, and functions to return a result.
4. Operators
Operators are symbols that perform operations on data values.
Types of operators:
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Comparison Operators: =, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT
String Operators: || (concatenation in some databases)
BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL, etc.
5. Identifiers
Identifiers are names used to refer to database objects like tables, columns, views, and indexes.
Examples: students, student_name, age, etc.
6. Values
Values are the data or constants that are used in SQL statements (numbers, strings, dates, etc.).
Examples: 42, 'John Doe', '2024-11-21'.


2. Write the general structure of an SQL SELECT statement

General Structure of a SQL SELECT Statement:

SELECT [DISTINCT] column1, column2, ..., columnN
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column1, column2, ...]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column1, column2, ... [ASC|DESC]]
[LIMIT number_of_records];

3. Explain the role of clauses in SQL statements.

Clauses in SQL statements are fundamental components that help define and structure the actions of a query.
 Each clause in an SQL statement plays a specific role, dictating how the query behaves and what data it manipulates or retrieves. 
 Below is an explanation of the most common clauses used in SQL statements and their roles:
