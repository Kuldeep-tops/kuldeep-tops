1. What is the GROUP BY clause in SQL? How is it used with aggregate functions?

GROUP BY Clause in SQL
The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups. 
It is often used in combination with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX() to perform calculations 
on each group of rows and return a summary or report of the data.
 The GROUP BY clause helps you aggregate or summarize data by one or more columns. For example, you might group data by categories like department,
region, product_type, or date and then perform aggregate functions like counting the number of records in each group,
 calculating the total sales for each group, or finding the average value for each group.
 It organizes the result set into groups of rows that share the same values in specified columns.

2. Explain the difference between GROUP BY and ORDER BY.

The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses in SQL are both used to organize query results, but they serve different purposes and operate in different ways.
 Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

1. Purpose
GROUP BY:
The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns, usually for the purpose of applying aggregate functions (such as COUNT(), 
SUM(), AVG(), etc.) to each group of rows. It helps you summarize data by creating groups.
It is primarily used when you want to aggregate data into summary results (e.g., the total sales per product or the average score per student).
ORDER BY:
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns, either in ascending (default) or descending order.
 It simply arranges the rows based on the specified column(s).
It does not perform any aggregation or grouping of rows; it just arranges the rows in a specific order based on your criteria (e.g., 
sorting products by price or sorting employees by their hire date).

2. How They Work
GROUP BY:
It groups rows that have the same values in one or more columns and then allows you to perform aggregate functions on each group (e.g., SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()).
After grouping, you can use aggregate functions on other columns that aren't included in the GROUP BY clause.
It reduces the number of rows in the result set, as multiple rows can be aggregated into a single row for each group.
ORDER BY:
It sorts the rows returned by the query based on the specified columns, either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
It does not change the number of rows; all rows in the result set are returned in a sorted order.
You can sort by one or more columns, and you can apply sorting to any column, even columns that aren't part of the GROUP BY clause.

3. Common Use Cases
GROUP BY:
When you want to summarize or aggregate data, such as:
Counting the number of items in each category.
Calculating the total sales for each department.
Finding the average score for each student.
ORDER BY:
When you want to sort your result set based on one or more columns, such as:
Sorting products by price in ascending or descending order.
Sorting employees by their hire date.
Sorting sales records by the date of the transaction.
