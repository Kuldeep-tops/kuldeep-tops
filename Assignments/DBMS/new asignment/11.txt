1. Explain the concept of JOIN in SQL. What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFTJOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN?

In SQL, the JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
The primary purpose of JOINs is to retrieve data from multiple tables that are logically related, typically via a foreign key or a shared attribute.
Types of JOINS in SQL:
There are several types of joins in SQL, each defining how rows from the two tables are matched. 
1. INNER JOIN:
An INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables involved in the join. 
If a row from either table does not have a corresponding match in the other table, it will not be included in the result set.

Only rows that have matching values in both tables are returned.
Use case: Use this when you only want to see the rows where there is a match between the two tables.
Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (the first table), and the matched rows from the right table (the second table). 
If there is no match, the result will still include all rows from the left table, with NULL values for columns from the right table where there is no match.

All rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table (or NULL if no match exists).
Use case: Use this when you want to see all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table, including rows from the left table that have no match.
Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
A RIGHT JOIN works similarly to the LEFT JOIN, but it returns all rows from the right table (the second table) and the matched rows from the left table(the first table). 
If there is no match, the result will still include all rows from the right table, with NULL values for columns from the left table where there is no match.
All rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table (or NULL if no match exists).
 Use this when you want to see all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table, including rows from the right table that have no match.
Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

4. FULL OUTER JOIN:
A FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in either the left table or the right table. If there is no match, 
the result will include NULL for the columns of the table that lacks a match.
All rows from both the left and right tables. If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for the missing side.
Use case: Use this when you want to include all rows from both tables, even if they do not have a match.
Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

2. How are joins used to combine data from multiple tables?

In SQL, joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a common attribute (typically a foreign key or related column). 
The purpose of joins is to allow you to query and retrieve related data from different tables in a single result set, helping to make sense of complex
 relationships between data stored in a relational database.
Relationship between Tables: In a relational database, tables are often related through keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys.
 A primary key uniquely identifies a record in one table, while a foreign key is a field in another table that refers to the primary key of the first table.
 A join allows you to combine data from multiple tables by comparing columns that contain related information (usually based on keys).
 This allows you to pull together related rows into a single result set.

The JOIN operation is typically used in the FROM clause of an SQL query, specifying the tables to combine and the condition that defines
 how the tables should be joined. You can join two or more tables in a query, and the join will return a result set that merges the data from those tables.

1. INNER JOIN:
This will return only the rows that have matching values in both tables. If there is no match between the tables based on the join condition, the row is excluded.

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
This will return all rows from the left table (in this case, students), and the matching rows from the right table (enrollments).
If there is no match in the right table, the result will contain NULL for columns from the right table.

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
This is similar to the LEFT JOIN, but it returns all rows from the right table (enrollments), and the matching rows from the left table (students).
 If there is no match in the left table, the result will contain NULL for columns from the left table.

4. FULL OUTER JOIN:
This will return all rows from both the left table and the right table. If there is no match, the result will contain NULL for the missing side.
