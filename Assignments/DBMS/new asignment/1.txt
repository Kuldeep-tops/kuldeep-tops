1.Introduction to SQL

1. What is SQL, and why is it essential in database management?

SQL is a structured query language(SQL): most databases use
 SQL to write & query data.

 Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing
  and processing information in a relational database.
   A relational database stores information in tabular form, 
   with rows and columns representing different data attributes 
   and the various relationships between the data values.

   Why is SQL important?
Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language 
that is frequently used in all types of applications.
 Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it 
 integrates well with different programming languages. For example,
  they can embed SQL queries with the Java programming language to
   build high-performing data processing applications with major SQL 
   database systems such as Oracle or MS SQL Server. SQL is also fairly
    easy to learn as it uses common English keywords in its statements

History of SQL
SQL was invented in the 1970s based on the relational data model.
 It was initially known as the structured English query language (SEQUEL). 
 The term was later shortened to SQL. Oracle, formerly known as Relational
  Software, became the first vendor to offer a commercial SQL relational 
  database management system.

  2. What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS
stores data in files, and does not link data together.DBMS 
is typically used by small organizations with fewer users and data.

RDBMS
stores data in tables, and links data together. RDBMS is
more sophisticated than DBMS and canhandle large amounts 
of data more efficiently.

security: RDBMS is more secure than DBMS.

speed: RDBMS is faster than DBMS.

number of users: DBMS allows only one users & RDBMS allows multiple users.

data redundency: DBMS  often have repeated data, but RDBMS prevents this 
with indexing.

normalization: DBMS is not allow normalization, but RDBMS is allow 
normalization NF1,NF2,NF3,BCNF.

RDMS is support client server architecture, but DBMS does not support it.


3. Describe the role of SQL in managing relational databases

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that's
 used to manage relational databases by storing, retrieving, updating, and
  manipulating data. SQL is the underlying language for relational database 
  management systems (RDBMS) like Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. 
Here are some ways SQL is used to manage relational databases:
Store and retrieve data: SQL statements can be used to store,
 update, remove, search, and retrieve information from a database. 
Maintain and optimize database performance: SQL can be used to maintain
 and optimize database performance. 
Modify database structures: SQL can be used to modify database 
table and index structures. 
Set up and run analytical queries: SQL can be used by data analysts
 to set up and run analytical queries. 
SQL was developed by IBM in the early 1970s and became commercially
 available in 1979. It's pronounced as "sequel" or "ess-que-el". 

 4.Here are some key features of Structured Query Language (SQL):

Data Definition Language (DDL):
 SQL provides a set of commands 
to define and modify the structure of a database, including creating tables,
 modifying table structure, and dropping tables.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): 
SQL provides a set of commands 
to manipulate data within a database, including adding, modifying,
 and deleting data.
 
 Query Language: 
 SQL provides a rich set of commands for querying
  a database to retrieve data, including the ability to filter, sort,
   group, and join data from multiple tables.

Transaction Control:
 SQL supports transaction processing,
 which allows users to group a set of database operations into a
  single transaction that can be rolled back in case of failure.

  Data Integrity: 
  SQL includes features to enforce data integrity,
   such as the ability to specify constraints on the values that
    can be inserted or updated in a table, and to enforce referential
     integrity between tables.

    User Access Control:
     SQL provides mechanisms to control user access
     to a database, including the ability to grant and revoke privileges to
   perform certain operations on the database.

Portability: 
SQL is a standardized language, meaning that SQL code
 written for one database management system can be used on another
  system with minimal modification.

  Overall, SQL provides a powerful set of tools for managing and
   querying relational databases, making it a popular choice for data management
    tasks.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used for writing
 queries in a databases. It was approved by ISO
  (International Standard Organization) and 
  ANSI(American National Standards Institute).
