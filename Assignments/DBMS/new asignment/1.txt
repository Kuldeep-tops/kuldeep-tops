1.Introduction to SQL

1. What is SQL, and why is it essential in database management?

SQL is a structured query language(SQL): most databases use
 SQL to write & query data.
 Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing
 and processing information in a relational database.
 A relational database stores information in tabular form, 
 with rows and columns representing different data attributes 
 and the various relationships between the data values.
 Why is SQL important?
 Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language 
 that is frequently used in all types of applications.
 Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it 
 integrates well with different programming languages. 

2. What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS
stores data in files, and does not link data together.DBMS 
is typically used by small organizations with fewer users and data.
RDBMS
stores data in tables, and links data together. RDBMS is
more sophisticated than DBMS and canhandle large amounts 
of data more efficiently.
security: RDBMS is more secure than DBMS.
speed: RDBMS is faster than DBMS.
number of users: DBMS allows only one users & RDBMS allows multiple users.
data redundency: DBMS  often have repeated data, but RDBMS prevents this 
with indexing.
normalization: DBMS is not allow normalization, but RDBMS is allow 
normalization NF1,NF2,NF3,BCNF.
RDMS is support client server architecture, but DBMS does not support it.

3. Describe the role of SQL in managing relational databases

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that's
 used to manage relational databases by storing, retrieving, updating, and
  manipulating data. 
Store and retrieve data: SQL statements can be used to store,
 update, remove, search, and retrieve information from a database. 
Maintain and optimize database performance: SQL can be used to maintain
 and optimize database performance. 
Modify database structures: SQL can be used to modify database 
table and index structures. 
Set up and run analytical queries: SQL can be used by data analysts
 to set up and run analytical queries. 

 4.Here are some key features of Structured Query Language (SQL):

Data Definition Language (DDL):
 SQL provides a set of commands to define and modify the structure of a database, including creating tables,
 modifying table structure, and dropping tables.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): 
SQL provides a set of commands to manipulate data within a database, including adding, modifying,
 and deleting data.
 
 Query Language: 
 SQL provides a rich set of commands for querying a database to retrieve data, including the ability to filter, sort,
   group, and join data from multiple tables.

Transaction Control:
 SQL supports transaction processing,which allows users to group a set of database operations into a
  single transaction that can be rolled back in case of failure.

  Data Integrity: 
  SQL includes features to enforce data integrity,such as the ability to specify constraints on the values that
    can be inserted or updated in a table, and to enforce referential integrity between tables.
