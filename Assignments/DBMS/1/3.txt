3. What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS
stores data in files, and does not link data together.DBMS 
is typically used by small organizations with fewer users and data.

RDBMS
stores data in tables, and links data together. RDBMS is
more sophisticated than DBMS and canhandle large amounts 
of data more efficiently.

security: RDBMS is more secure than DBMS.

speed: RDBMS is faster than DBMS.

number of users: DBMS allows only one users & RDBMS allows multiple users.

data redundency: DBMS  often have repeated data, but RDBMS prevents this 
with indexing.

normalization: DBMS is not allow normalization, but RDBMS is allow 
normalization NF1,NF2,NF3,BCNF.

RDMS is support client server architecture, but DBMS does not support it.
