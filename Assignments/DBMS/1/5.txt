What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

Data redundancy is when the same data is stored in multiple places, 
such as across different departments or storage systems.
 It can be a common occurrence in businesses, especially those that don't
 use a central database. 
Data redundancy can be beneficial when used for backup or data security, 
but it can also lead to problems: 
Storage costs: Data redundancy can lead to increased storage costs. 
Errors: Inconsistent information can lead to errors and compromised analytics. 
Confusing users: It can be difficult for users to identify which data to access or update. 
Corrupt reports: Inconsistent information can lead to corrupt reports 
and analytics. 
There are two types of data redundancy:Positive data redundancy
This is intentional and occurs when an organization creates compressed versions of data 
to use as a backup.
Wasteful data redundancy
This is unintentional and can result from inefficient coding or 
complicated data processes. 
Data managers can use data management courses to learn 
how to reduce data redundancy and optimize data storage.
