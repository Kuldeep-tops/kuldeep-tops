In c programming structure and union are used to stored memory and manage memory.


Structure:

Structure allocates separate memory for each member.

Structures allow you to work with all members at once.

All members can be accessed independently.

Used when you want to store multiple different types of data that will be used simultaneously.

ex:			
	struct example{

			
		     };

Union:

while Union shares the same memory for all members.
 
while in unions, only one member is valid at a time due to shared memory.

Only one member can be accessed at a time. Changing the value of one member will overwrite the memory shared by all members.

Used when you need to store different types of data, but only one of them will be used at any given time, allowing for more efficient memory usage.

ex:
		union example{
				int a;
			        float b;
			         char c;
			    };
